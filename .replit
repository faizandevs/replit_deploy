.replit file configuration

--- 1. PYTHON VERSION CONFIGURATION ---

We explicitly request Python 3.11. Replit will use the latest available

patch version (like 3.11.1) for this module.

modules = ["python-3.11"]

--- 2. RUN COMMAND (For the 'Run' Button) ---

This command starts the FastAPI server using Uvicorn.

We bind to 0.0.0.0 and use a fixed port (8080) which is reliably exposed

by Replit for the development environment.

run = "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080"

Note on the command parameters:

- --host 0.0.0.0: MANDATORY to bind to all interfaces for Replit's web view.

- --port 8080: This is a standard port Replit's development environment exposes.

For a final, public Autoscale Deployment, Replit automatically handles

the port using its $PORT environment variable, regardless of this setting.
