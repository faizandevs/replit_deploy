--- 2. SET ENTRYPOINT AND RUN COMMAND ---

The 'run' command specifies how the application should be started

when you click the 'Run' button in the Replit interface.

run = "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080"

Note on the run command:

- uvicorn: The ASGI server.

- main:app: Refers to the 'app' object inside the 'main.py' file.

- --host 0.0.0.0: Binds to all interfaces, required for Replit.

- --port 8080: Replit automatically exposes port 8080 (or $PORT)

for deployments, but 8080 is often reliable for the local 'Run' button.
